This folder holds the development source files for the Worldmaking Max package. 

At present development occurs on the master branch. After the first release, a separate development branch will be used.

## Dependencies

Normal C++ development tools setup for the platform (Visual Studio 2015, or Xcode). 

It depends on having the [Max SDK package](https://github.com/Cycling74/max-sdk) (note, not the max6-sdk!) also installed in the Max Packages folder, i.e. the "max-sdk" folder is found two folders up from here.
